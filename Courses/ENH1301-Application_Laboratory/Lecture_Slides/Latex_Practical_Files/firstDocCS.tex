We present a 5\textsuperscript{th} scalable $5^2$ dynamic \textsubscript{subscript} analysis framework that allows for the automatic evaluation of the privacy behaviors of Android apps. We use our system to analyze mobile apps’ compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), one of the few stringent privacy laws in the U.S. Based on our automated analysis of 5,855 of the most popular free children’s apps, we found that a majority are potentially inviolation of COPPA, mainly due to their use of thirdparty SDKs. While many of these SDKs oﬀer configuration options to respect COPPA by disabling tracking and behavioral advertising, our data suggest that a majority of apps either do not make use of these optionsor incorrectly propagate them across mediation SDKs.
